```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(animalsounds)
```

Maybe I should just copy some info from my readme. 

But okay, here we go again. Print what an animal says:

```{r}
animal_sounds("mule","i-a")
```

And not only that. It also contains data to help you learn about the sounds animals make.

```{r}
farm_animals
```
